Ques-1>	Function
*  Larger program is divided into various subprograms which are called as functions.
*  When some specific code is to be used more than once and at a time and at different places in the program, the use of function avoid repetition of that code. The function can be written      once and called at different places in the program.
*  The program become easily understandable,modify. It becomes simple to write the program and understand what work is done by each part of the program.

Ques-2> What is a method in Java?
   A method is a block of code to perform a certain task or operation. It is used to achieve the reusability of code. The function can be written once and called at    different places in the program. We do not require to write code again and again. It also provides the easy modification and readability of code.
   
   Method Declaration
   The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such as visibility, return-type, name, and arguments. 
   It has six components:-
   * Method Signature:It includes the method name and parameter list.
   * Access modifier: It specifies the visibility of the method. Java provides four types of access specifier:-
	+ Public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public specifier in our application.
	+ Private: When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.
	+ Protected: When we use protected access specifier, the method is accessible within the same package.
	+ Default: When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. It is visible only from the same                      package only
   * Return Type: Return type is a data type that the method returns. If the method does not return anything, we use void keyword.
   * Method Name: It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method. It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method
   * Parameter List: It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses. It contains the data type and variable name
   * Method Body: It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed. It is enclosed within the pair of curly braces.
